fast vs. slow tempo 
the slower the tempo, the greater the margin of error is (17.5%).
This may make you inclined to favour slower tempos (ie. half time instead of normal time)

pros:
	larger window, more room for error. So beats that were nearly on track but not quite would get in here.

cons:
	if a beat is missed, this has a bigger percentage impact on the result than before.
	if the annotation is on the off beat and then tempo is halved this would result in zero.
		this is what dramatically impacts our results.
